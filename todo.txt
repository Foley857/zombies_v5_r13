- Gameplay changes
    - Zombie bots
        - add waypoint system
            - basic wps across all stock maps
            - each map needs at least two entry points for bots
            - ladder, jump, crouch/prone wp types
            - ignore wp for tricky collision spots
        - bots
            - custom ai
            - basically like all the dumb zombies you see in movies
            - mental states:
                - idle
                - roaming
                - following
                - attacking
                - dead
            - default to roaming if no players are round
            - 110Â° FOV (or there abouts)
        - bots now replace "first zombie" selection method
        - bot count is variable, depending on number of players and map
        - at least 1.5x, up to 3x if map is large enough
        - goal is to have a maximum of 48 zombies (29 players + 19 bots)
    - Rank overhaul
        - lua code used to generate ranks
            total = 0
            for i=1,levels do
                print( i .. ": " .. math.floor(total) .. "    " .. math.floor(tnl) )
                total = total + tnl
                tnl = tnl * ( 1 + math.pow( factor, i ) )
            end
