  "body": "# Zombies \r\n\r\nZombies is a modification for Call of Duty 1.1. It is my take on the classic Zombies gamemodes as seen in many, many other games, but built to work within the limitations and confines of the original Call of Duty. It is meant to act as a (mostly) server-side only modification, requiring no downloads. This version was originally built/\"completed\" in May of 2011, but I have since resurrected it due to renewed interest by several other parties. I have slowly begun reworking and fixing various bugs, removing old and bad coding habits, and importing new features along the way. \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- Call of Duty version 1.1\r\n- CoDExtended (at least version v20)\r\n- Any flavour of Linux you like\r\n\r\n### Some notes\r\n\r\nYou can probably try and get this working without CoDExtended -- I'm only really using it for file I/O and a few of its functions. I left the original stats saving method (with cvars) in `_stats_legacy.gsc`, so if you really want to work without CoDExtended there are instructions in `_stats.gsc` for getting that working. Otherwise good luck in trying to convert it. I was originally trying to make it work for both, but that's really too much work and I can't be bothered. Sorry.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me on Steam at [thecheeseman999](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecheeseman999/) if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or hate mail.\r\n\r\n# To-do\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add classes: recon, support, medic, sniper, engineer\r\n    -
